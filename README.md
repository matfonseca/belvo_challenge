# Belvo Challenge

### Setup
You need to have Python 3.12 installed. We recommend using Conda or any other similar tool like Pyenv.

To create a Conda environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `conda create --name belvo-env python=3.12` to create a new environment named `belvo-env` with Python 3.12.
4. Activate the environment by running `conda activate belvo-env` 
5. If you don't have Poetry installed, install it by running `pip install poetry`.
6. Install the project dependencies using Poetry by running `poetry install`.
